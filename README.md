K-Means Clustering: Manual Implementation
This repository contains a manual implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch using Python. The implementation avoids any predefined machine learning libraries, providing a clear understanding of the algorithm's inner workings.

Features
K-Means Algorithm: Iteratively assigns points to clusters and updates centroids.
Inertia Calculation: Computes the sum of squared distances for cluster evaluation.
Elbow Method: Determines the optimal number of clusters by identifying the "elbow point" in the inertia curve.
